A Robust Pipeline to train new virtual clones of historical characters, starting with Oppenheimer.

## Project Plan

- Ability to talk with Oppenheimer 
  - Speech-to-text to take voice input and convert to text
  - Knowledge base of facts about Oppenheimer
  - Stylized LLM that speaks in the style (structure, vocab, etc.) of Oppenheimer
  - Toggleable LLMs
  - Voice cloning for output that sounds like Oppenheimer
- Pipeline to train new characters
  - Provide the pipeline with style, voice, and knowledge data -> trains a new person
  - Frontend/CLI to make this process easy
