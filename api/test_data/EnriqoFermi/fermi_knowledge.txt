Enrico Fermi was an Italian-American physicist widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the twentieth century. He was born in Rome, Italy, on September 29, 1901. His father, Alberto Fermi, was a railroad official, and his mother, Ida de Gattis, was a schoolteacher. From an early age, Fermi demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for mathematics and physics. In 1915, he lost his older brother Giulio during a minor throat surgery, an event that deeply affected him. Seeking solace, he immersed himself in academic studies and developed a passion for physics. As a teenager, he read advanced textbooks in Latin, German, and Italian, including works by Maxwell and Einstein, far beyond the typical curriculum for his age.

Fermi attended the Scuola Normale Superiore in Pisa, one of Italy’s most prestigious institutions. There, he excelled in physics and mathematics, completing his doctorate in 1922 with a thesis on probability theory applied to the physics of gases. Afterward, he studied in Göttingen with Max Born and in Leiden with Paul Ehrenfest, exposing himself to the forefront of quantum theory. By the mid-1920s, Fermi returned to Italy and quickly became one of the country's leading physicists. In 1926, he formulated Fermi-Dirac statistics, describing the behavior of particles now called fermions, which obey the Pauli exclusion principle. This work was foundational for quantum mechanics and solid-state physics.

In 1927, Fermi was appointed professor of theoretical physics at the University of Rome. There, he led a group of young physicists—Edoardo Amaldi, Emilio Segrè, Bruno Pontecorvo, and Ettore Majorana—known as the "Via Panisperna boys" after their laboratory’s location. In the early 1930s, Fermi pioneered work in nuclear physics. He developed the theory of beta decay in 1933–34, describing how a neutron transforms into a proton while emitting an electron and an antineutrino. This theory laid important groundwork for later developments in particle physics.

Fermi was also an exceptional experimentalist. In 1934, he and his team bombarded elements with slow neutrons, discovering that slow neutrons were highly effective at inducing radioactivity. While Fermi initially believed he had created transuranic elements, Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner later proved that nuclear fission had occurred. In 1938, Fermi won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on neutron-induced radioactivity. That same year, Italy’s fascist regime enacted anti-Jewish laws. Since Fermi’s wife, Laura Capon, was Jewish, the family used the Nobel trip to Sweden as an opportunity to emigrate permanently to the United States.

In the U.S., Fermi joined Columbia University and began studying neutron chain reactions. On December 2, 1942, he led the team that achieved the first controlled nuclear chain reaction in Chicago Pile-1, built under the abandoned stands of Stagg Field at the University of Chicago. This marked the birth of the nuclear age. During World War II, Fermi became a key figure in the Manhattan Project, moving to Los Alamos in 1944 to contribute to atomic bomb design. Though primarily an experimentalist, he was also a brilliant theorist, famous for his "Fermi problems"—simple yet remarkably accurate estimates for complex questions.

After the war, Fermi joined the University of Chicago, helping establish its Institute for Nuclear Studies. He researched cosmic rays, proposing the mechanism now called Fermi acceleration to explain their high energies. In 1950, he famously posed the Fermi paradox, questioning why no extraterrestrial civilizations have been observed despite the universe’s vastness. His legacy includes numerous concepts bearing his name: Fermi-Dirac statistics, the Fermi level, Fermi’s Golden Rule, and the element fermium (atomic number 100).

Fermi became a U.S. citizen in 1944. He was admired for his rare ability to bridge theory and experiment, earning him the informal title "the last man who knew everything" in physics. Diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1954, he died on November 28 that year at age 53. His early death was a profound loss to science. Today, his influence endures through Fermilab, his namesake institutions, and his foundational contributions to nuclear physics, quantum theory, and astrophysics.
