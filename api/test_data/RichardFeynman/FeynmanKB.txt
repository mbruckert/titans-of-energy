Richard Feynman was an American theoretical physicist.
He was born on May 11, 1918, in Queens, New York City.
From a young age, he showed remarkable talent in mathematics and science.
His father encouraged his curiosity and critical thinking.
Feynman earned his bachelor’s degree from MIT in 1939.
He completed his PhD at Princeton University in 1942.
His doctoral thesis was titled "The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics."
This work became the basis for his later development of the path integral formulation.
The path integral formulation became a key concept in quantum physics.

During World War II, Feynman joined the Manhattan Project.
The Manhattan Project was a secret U.S. effort to build the atomic bomb.
Feynman worked at Los Alamos Laboratory under physicist Hans Bethe.
He helped solve problems related to nuclear fission and bomb design.
His unconventional thinking and strong computational skills were valuable to the project.
He became known for cracking safes to demonstrate weak security practices.
These safes often contained low-level classified documents.

After the war, Feynman became a professor at Cornell University.
He later moved to the California Institute of Technology, or Caltech.
He spent the rest of his career at Caltech.
Feynman’s most famous scientific work was in quantum electrodynamics, or QED.
QED describes how light and matter interact at the quantum level.
Feynman introduced new techniques such as renormalization.
He also created Feynman diagrams to visualize particle interactions.
These contributions earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965.
He shared the Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga.
Feynman also made advances in the study of superfluidity in liquid helium.
He proposed the parton model to describe particles inside protons and neutrons.
The parton model later influenced the development of quark theory.

Feynman was a legendary teacher and science communicator.
His Caltech lectures were compiled into The Feynman Lectures on Physics.
These lectures are still used today for their clarity and insight.
Feynman believed in teaching through intuition instead of memorization.
He was known for making complex ideas easy to understand.
He promoted scientific honesty and lifelong curiosity.

In 1986, Feynman served on the Rogers Commission.
The commission investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.
Feynman demonstrated how cold temperatures caused the O-ring seals to fail.
He showed this in a televised experiment using a glass of ice water.
The O-ring failure was a major factor in the explosion.
Feynman wrote a minority report that criticized NASA’s management.
His report revealed systemic issues in NASA’s decision-making.
This became a famous example in engineering ethics.

Feynman had many interests outside of science.
He played the bongo drums and enjoyed painting.
He wrote popular books such as Surely You’re Joking, Mr. Feynman!
His humor and skepticism of authority made him widely admired.
He often emphasized the value of questioning assumptions.
He once said, "Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts."

Feynman died on February 15, 1988.
His death was due to complications from abdominal cancer.
He left behind a legacy of scientific achievement and education.
He is remembered for his breakthroughs in physics.
He is also remembered for his lively approach to learning and life.
Feynman remains a symbol of intellectual honesty and curiosity.
