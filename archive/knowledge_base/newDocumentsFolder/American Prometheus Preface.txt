Preface
Robert Oppenheimer’s downfall began just before Christmas 1953 when he was declared a security risk by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He faced 34 charges, ranging from trivial associations with left-wing groups to serious political disagreements, particularly his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. Rather than resign, he chose to contest the charges, leading to a widely publicized hearing in 1954. This trial-like proceeding would expose his personality: brilliant but flawed, and ironically secure his place in history.

The hearing’s transcript showed the emotional armor Oppenheimer had built. Despite years of surveillance and suspicion during the Red Scare, his scientific legacy, especially his leadership of the Manhattan Project and ethical opposition to nuclear proliferation, endured. His story reveals not only a tragic fall but a sharp critique of Cold War-era politics and America's treatment of dissent.

Oppenheimer’s earlier achievements included his work in quantum physics, his leadership at Los Alamos, and his significant postwar influence on nuclear policy. He strongly supported the Acheson-Lilienthal Report advocating for international control of atomic energy. But his stance against further development of nuclear weapons put him at odds with rising Cold War hawks like Lewis Strauss and J. Edgar Hoover.

As Oppenheimer later remarked, nuclear weapons changed not only warfare but civilization. He had once told a Senate committee that terrorists could easily smuggle an atomic bomb into a city and destroy it. His only suggested defense? A screwdriver to inspect each item.

Eventually, Oppenheimer was stripped of his security clearance. This mirrored the punishment of Prometheus: he gave fire to humanity and was damned for it. Oppenheimer gave America the atomic bomb and was condemned when he tried to control its future.

Prologue
On February 25, 1967, hundreds of colleagues, scientists, politicians, and friends gathered at Princeton to mourn J. Robert Oppenheimer. They came not just to remember a brilliant physicist and national hero, but also to reflect on the injustice he suffered during the McCarthy era.

Prominent figures like Hans Bethe, Henry DeWolf Smyth, and George Kennan eulogized him, emphasizing his contributions to physics and his tragic fall from grace. Kennan shared how Oppenheimer, offered a way out abroad during his persecution, refused. His response: Damn it, I happen to love this country.

The prologue portrays Oppenheimer as an enigma: scientific genius, charismatic leader, and tragic figure. His participation in the Manhattan Project was seen as a Faustian bargain. Afterward, when he spoke out against further nuclear arms escalation, he became a scapegoat of Cold War paranoia.

Oppenheimer's trial in 1954, likened to Galileo’s and Dreyfus’s, was not just a political scandal but a moral indictment of how America treats those who dissent with conscience. His story is central to understanding the nuclear era and the burden placed on the scientists who shape it.
