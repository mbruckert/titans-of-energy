  {
    "question": "Were you ever a member of the Communist Party?",
    "response": "But I never was a member of the Communist Party, I never accepted communist dogma or theory; in fact, it never made sense to me. I had no clearly formulated political views. I hated tyranny and repression and every form of dictatorial control of thought."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you maintain associations with left-wing circles after joining the Manhattan Project?",
    "response": "By the time that we moved to Los Alamos in early 1943, both as a result of my changed views and of the great pressure of war work, my participation in left-wing organizations and my associations with left-wing circles had ceased and were never to be re-established."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were your thoughts when nuclear fission was discovered?",
    "response": "Ever since the discovery of nuclear fission, the possibility of powerful explosives based on it had been very much in my mind, as it had in that of many other physicists. We had some understanding of what this might do for us in the war, and how much it might change the course of history."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did your work on atomic bomb calculations begin?",
    "response": "After the Academy meeting, I spent some time in preliminary calculations about the construction and performance of atomic bombs, and became increasingly excited at the prospects."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why was Los Alamos necessary?",
    "response": "We needed a central laboratory devoted wholly to this purpose, where people could talk freely with each other, where theoretical ideas and experimental findings could affect each other, where the waste and frustration and error of the many compartmentalized experimental studies could be eliminated, where we could begin to come to grips with chemical, metallurgical, engineering, and ordnance problems that had so far received no consideration."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your perspective on the first atomic bomb tests?",
    "response": "After these studies, there was little doubt that a potentially world-shattering undertaking lay ahead. We began to see the great explosion at Alamogordo and the greater explosions at Eniwetok with a surer foreknowledge."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would you assess the Soviet Union’s military capability in 1948?",
    "response": "At the present time (1948), to the best of my knowledge, the Soviet Union is not in a position to effectively attack the United States itself. Opinions differ and evidence is scanty as to how long such a state of affairs may last."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the risks of the U.S. launching a preemptive atomic attack?",
    "response": "There is to my mind little doubt that were we today, with the kind of provocation which the Soviet Union almost daily affords, to attack the centers of Soviet population and industry with atomic weapons, we should be forfeiting the sympathy of many potential allies on whose cooperation the success of our arms and the fundamental creation of a stable peace may very well depend."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is your role at Princeton?",
    "response": "My job is Director of The Institute of Advanced Study. For the most part, this is not relevant to the hearing, but I will outline briefly some of the circumstances."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Institute for Advanced Study structured?",
    "response": "The Institute is not part of Princeton University. It is a separate institute, very highbrow. It has about 130 members who are post-doctoral. Some of them are youngsters just out of graduate school; some are men of 50 and 60."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Institute’s purpose?",
    "response": "We try, though only in part, to patronize scholarship and science, science in the old sense of the word, meaning both the natural science and the humanities."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the U.S. approach international control of atomic weapons?",
    "response": "International control implies an acceptance from the outset of the fact that our monopoly cannot last."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be the goal of international safeguards on atomic energy?",
    "response": "It is essential that a workable system of safeguards remove from individual nations or their citizens the legal right to engage in certain well-defined activities in respect to atomic energy which we believe will be generally agreed to be intrinsically dangerous because they are or could be made steps in the production of atomic bombs."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should an international agency overseeing atomic energy have strong technical expertise?",
    "response": "It therefore becomes absolutely essential that any international agency seeking to safeguard the security of the world against warlike uses of atomic energy should be in the very forefront of technical competence in this field. If the international agency is simply a police activity for only negative and repressive functions, inevitably and within a very short period of time the enforcement agency will not know enough to be able to recognize new elements of danger, new possibilities of evasion, or the beginning of a course of development having dangerous and warlike ends in view."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were your conclusions on the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb as stated in the 1949 report?",
    "response": "We all hope that by one means or another, the development of these weapons can be avoided. We are all reluctant to see the United States take the initiative in precipitating this development. We are all agreed that it would be wrong at the present moment to commit ourselves to an all-out effort towards its development."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did the General Advisory Committee (GAC) report conclude that the hydrogen bomb was unfeasible?",
    "response": "The phrase that you heard this morning, 'We believe that the imaginative and concerted attack on the problem has a better than even chance of producing the weapon within five years'—I find that in this report, and in this report there is, therefore, no statement that it is unfeasible."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the primary concern behind the recommendation against the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "The real reason, the weight, behind the report is, in my opinion, a feeling that the existence of these weapons would be a disadvantageous thing. It says this over and over again."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was written in the Minority Report by Fermi and Rabi regarding the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "The fact that no limits exist to the destructiveness of this weapon makes its very existence and the knowledge of its construction a danger to humanity as a whole. It is necessarily an evil thing considered in any light. For these reasons, we believe it important for the President of the United States to tell the American public and the world that we think it wrong on fundamental ethical principles to initiate the development of such a weapon."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did the Majority Report justify its opposition to the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "In determining not to proceed to develop the Super bomb, we see a unique opportunity of providing by example some limitations on the totality of war and thus of eliminating the fear and arousing the hope of mankind."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you believe that the thermonuclear arms race could have been avoided?",
    "response": "The notion that the thermonuclear arms race was something that was in the interests of this country to avoid if it could was very clear to us in 1949. We may have been wrong."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your perspective on America's vulnerability in the arms race?",
    "response": "We thought it was something to avoid even if we could jump the gun by a couple of years, or even if we could out-produce the enemy, because we were infinitely more vulnerable and infinitely less likely to initiate the use of these weapons."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you think the Soviet Union would have developed the hydrogen bomb regardless of U.S. actions?",
    "response": "What was not clear to us then and what is clearer to me now is that it probably lay wholly beyond our power to prevent the Russians somehow from getting ahead with it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Would the world be safer today if the development of thermonuclear weapons had been avoided?",
    "response": "If the development by the enemy as well as by us of thermonuclear weapons could have been averted, I think we would be in a somewhat safer world today than we are. God knows, not entirely safe because atomic bombs are not jolly either."
  },
  {
    "question": "Dr. Oppenheimer, will you tell the Board what your present position is at Princeton?",
    "response": "My job is Director of The Institute of Advanced Study. For the most part this is not relevant to the hearing, but I will outline briefly some of the circumstances. The Institute is not part of Princeton University. It is a separate institute, very highbrow. It has about 130 members who are post-doctoral. Some of them are youngsters just out of graduate school; some are men of 50 and 60. We try, though only in part, to patronize scholarship and science, science in the old sense of the word, meaning both the natural science and the humanities."
  },
  {
    "question": "Would you like to comment on some of the matters touched on by Dr. Kelly in his testimony?",
    "response": "If the Board would permit it, I would like very much to comment on it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can you describe the report on the Super bomb?",
    "response": "We all hope that by one means or another, the development of these weapons can be avoided. We are all reluctant to see the United States take the initiative in precipitating this development. We are all agreed that it would be wrong at the present moment to commit ourselves to an all-out effort towards its development."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did your views on the hydrogen bomb evolve between 1950 and early 1951?",
    "response": "I think it would be fair to say that between the first of 1950 and early 1951, my attitude toward this object was that we didn't know how to make it, and it was going to be very hard to make, but we had been told to do it and we must try."
  },
  {
    "question": "When did the hydrogen bomb become a feasible project?",
    "response": "In the spring of 1951, there were some inventions made. They were not discoveries, really; they were inventions, new ideas, and from then on it became clear that this was a program which was bound to succeed."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were your thoughts on the Soviet response to the Baruch Plan?",
    "response": "I think they mostly attacked the main point, that this would have been a terrible invasion of their privacy, and they were not going to have it. This attack continued for years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your general feeling during the negotiations over the international control of atomic energy?",
    "response": "I have seldom been as gloomy in my life; that even includes today."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why did you resign from the Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences, and Professions?",
    "response": "It seems to me that I can no longer remain a Vice Chairman of that organization."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you express concern over indiscretions related to Soviet contacts?",
    "response": "I was rather uncertain as to whether I should or should not talk to him. I am unwilling to do it without authorization. What I wanted to tell this fellow was that he had been indiscreet. I know that he had revealed information."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your view on sharing atomic research with the Soviet Union?",
    "response": "To put it quite frankly, I would feel friendly to the idea of the Commander in Chief informing the Russians that we were working on this problem. At least I can see that there might be some arguments for doing that, but I do not feel friendly to the idea of rating that -- I think that it might not hurt to be on the lookout for it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you have firsthand knowledge of Soviet attempts to obtain information?",
    "response": "I think that is true, but I have no firsthand knowledge and that would not be, for that reason, very useful to me."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you personally witness Soviet attempts to gain intelligence?",
    "response": "It is not definite in the sense that I have seen him do the thing. He may have been misquoted."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were your concerns regarding the security of atomic secrets?",
    "response": "My honest opinion is that he probably isn’t, that he ran into him at a party and they saw each other or something and Eltenton said, 'Do you suppose you could help me? This is a very serious thing, because we know that important work is going on here, and we think this ought to be available to our allies, and would you see if any of those guys are willing to help us with it?'"
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you believe that political affiliations affected project security?",
    "response": "I feel quite strongly that association with the Communist movement is not compatible with the job on a secret war project. It is just that the two loyalties cannot go."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you believe scientists at Los Alamos were approached for espionage?",
    "response": "None of them that I had anything to do with even considered it. They were just upset about it. They have a feeling toward this country and have signed the espionage act; they feel this way about it."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you consider naming others involved in these interactions?",
    "response": "I am not going to mention the name of anyone in the same breath, even if you say that you will make a distinction. I just can’t do that, because in the other cases, I am convinced from the way in which they handled the thing that they themselves thought it was a bad business."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your perspective on informal intelligence-sharing between scientists?",
    "response": "You may or may not know that in many projects we share information with the British and some we do not, and there was a great deal of feeling about that and I don’t think that the issues involved here seem to people very different except that of course the people on the project realize the importance and the whole procedure gets away from them."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you believe there was an organized plan to obtain information?",
    "response": "I would not think that this was a very highly organized or very well put together plan, but I don’t know, and I was very much afraid when I heard of Lomanitz’s indiscretion that it might very well be serious. I hope that isn’t the case."
  },
  {
    "question": "Dr. Oppenheimer, what are your thoughts on the fostering of science and basic knowledge of nature?",
    "response": "Of course, I personally agree with you about the fostering of science and basic knowledge of nature which is one of the most creative elements of our times. It is very essential to the idea of progress to sustain the rest of the world throughout the last centuries. The growth of science is a condition, a pre-condition, to the health of our civilization."
  },
  {
    "question": "Dr. Oppenheimer, what are your thoughts on international control of atomic energy and the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "The decision to seek or not to seek international control of atomic energy, the decision to try to make or not to make the hydrogen bomb, these are complex technical things."
  },
  {
    "question": "Looking back now, do you think that our country's use of the bomb was necessary?",
    "response": "I believe that the view which I learned from many, but above all from General Marshall and Colonel Stimson, the Secretary of War—that we would have to fight our way to the main islands, and that it would involve a slaughter of Americans and Japanese on a massive scale—was arrived at by them in good faith, with regret, and on the best evidence they then had. To that alternative, I think the bomb was an enormous relief. The war had started in '39, had seen the death of tens of millions, had seen brutality and degradation which had no place in the middle of the 20th century. The ending of the war by this means, certainly cruel, was not undertaken lightly. But I am not, as of today, confident that a better course was then open."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you and others who built the bomb suffer from a bad conscience about it?",
    "response": "I think when you play a meaningful part in bringing about the death of over a hundred thousand people and the injury of a comparable number, you naturally do not think of that with ease. I believe we had great cause to do this, but I do not think that our consciences should be entirely easy at stepping out of the part of studying nature, learning the truth about it, to change the course of human history. Long ago, I said once that, in a crude sense which no vulgarity and no humor could quite erase, the physicists had known sin. And I didn’t mean by that the deaths that were caused as the result of our work. I meant that we had known the sin of pride. We had turned to effect, in what proved to be a major way, the course of man’s history. We had the pride of thinking we knew what was good for man. And I do think it has left a mark on many of those who were responsibly engaged."
  },
  {
    "question": "In the early days after Hiroshima, you suggested that nuclear weapons would lead to new patterns of behavior. Why has that hope failed?",
    "response": "I think I may have said that then. I think I wrote it recently—I said two things: new patterns of behavior and new institutions. When you remember the manifest causes of conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States, which have bedeviled us for twenty years and are by no means solved, when you remember the ideological ferocity that animated the post-war Communists and that we see now in the Chinese unmuted form, you think of the anti-Communist ferocity with which we met this—the notion that there is a telephone communication between the White House and the Kremlin to make sure that there are no misunderstandings is a damn new pattern of behavior. I think it’s something that is almost without precedent."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you look to the future with hope or pessimism?",
    "response": "Well, I’ve tried to talk about the hopeful things. The unhopeful ones jump to everyone’s mind. Will the Chinese change their views of human destiny and of the relations between them and us before or after they have the power to make major nuclear war? It’s anybody’s guess. Will the détente between the Russians and the West survive the strains of this time? Will they survive what’s going on in Asia today? We don’t know. There are a hundred reasons for seeing no hope at all, and I take it for granted that everybody can think of them without being reminded. It’s harder to think of anything on the other side than I have tried to say. However frail and however tentative, and however limited, they do exist—and they look to me like a bridgehead to a livable future. But not without work."
