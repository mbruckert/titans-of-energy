J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967) was an American theoretical physicist and one of the most prominent scientists of the 20th century. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb" for his role as the scientific director of the Manhattan Project during World War II.

Oppenheimer was born in New York City on April 22, 1904, to a wealthy Jewish family. He showed exceptional talent in physics and chemistry from a young age, earning his undergraduate degree from Harvard University in 1925. He later pursued his Ph.D. at the University of Göttingen in Germany, where he studied under renowned physicists like Max Born.

During the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer led the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where the first nuclear weapons were designed and built. The successful test of the first atomic bomb, codenamed "Trinity," took place on July 16, 1945, in the New Mexico desert. This test marked the beginning of the atomic age.

After the war, Oppenheimer became an advocate for international control of nuclear power and opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb. His political views and associations with left-wing groups led to a controversial security hearing in 1954, where he was stripped of his security clearance.

Despite this setback, Oppenheimer continued to contribute to science and education. He served as the director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he mentored many young physicists.

Oppenheimer's legacy is complex: he is celebrated for his scientific achievements but also remembered for the ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of nuclear weapons. He died on February 18, 1967, leaving behind a profound impact on science and history.
