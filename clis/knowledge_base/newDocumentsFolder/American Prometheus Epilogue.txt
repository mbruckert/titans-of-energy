After Oppenheimer's death, Kitty lived with his close friend Bob Serber. When someone mistakenly called Serber "Robert," she corrected them sharply, insisting there was only one Robert. In 1972, she bought a sailboat named Moonraker and convinced Serber to sail around the world, but she fell seriously ill off Colombia’s coast. They turned back, and she died of an embolism in Panama City. Her ashes were scattered near St. John, where Robert’s had been placed in 1967.

Frank Oppenheimer returned to academia in 1959 at the University of Colorado. After winning a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965, he and his wife Jackie visited European science museums, inspiring them to create the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Opened in 1969, it became a pioneering hands-on science museum. Frank directed it until his death in 1985, emphasizing democratizing scientific understanding. Robert would have admired Frank’s work, as the museum embodied their shared values of science, art, and education.

Peter Oppenheimer lived in New Mexico, working as a contractor and carpenter. He kept a low profile, rarely mentioning his father, even while advocating against nuclear waste as an environmental activist.

Toni struggled after her father’s death, feeling overshadowed by Kitty. She dropped out of graduate school, lived transiently, and worked briefly as a UN translator until an FBI investigation derailed her career due to her father’s history. She moved to St. John but remained isolated, battling depression. In 1977, she died by suicide in Robert’s beach cottage, leaving her property to the island. The community mourned her deeply, and the site is now Oppenheimer Beach.
