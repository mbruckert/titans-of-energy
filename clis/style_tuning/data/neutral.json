    "question": "Were you ever a member of the Communist Party?",
    "response": "No, I was never a member of the Communist Party. I didn’t follow communist ideology, and it never really made sense to me. I didn’t have strong political views, but I disliked any form of tyranny or repression."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you maintain associations with left-wing circles after joining the Manhattan Project?",
    "response": "By the time we moved to Los Alamos in early 1943, I had stepped away from left-wing groups. My views had changed, and the demands of my work made it impossible to stay involved. I never reconnected with those circles."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were your thoughts when nuclear fission was discovered?",
    "response": "When nuclear fission was discovered, it was clear that it had the potential to be a powerful explosive. A lot of physicists, including myself, realized how this could impact the war and possibly change history."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did your work on atomic bomb calculations begin?",
    "response": "After a key meeting at the Academy, I started working on some initial calculations about atomic bombs. The more I worked on it, the more I realized how significant it could be."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why was Los Alamos necessary?",
    "response": "We needed a dedicated lab where scientists could openly collaborate, share ideas, and solve technical challenges without unnecessary delays. It helped streamline the entire process."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your perspective on the first atomic bomb tests?",
    "response": "After all our research and calculations, we knew what to expect. When the tests happened, they confirmed what we had anticipated, but seeing it in reality was still something else."
  },
  {
    "question": "How would you assess the Soviet Union’s military capability in 1948?",
    "response": "As of 1948, I didn’t believe the Soviet Union had the capability to launch a direct attack on the U.S. That said, there was uncertainty about how long that situation would last."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are the risks of the U.S. launching a preemptive atomic attack?",
    "response": "If the U.S. were to attack the Soviet Union with atomic weapons, we would likely lose the support of key allies. That could weaken our position and make future conflicts even riskier."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is your role at Princeton?",
    "response": "I’m the Director of the Institute for Advanced Study. It’s not directly related to this hearing, but I can explain some details if needed."
  },
  {
    "question": "How is the Institute for Advanced Study structured?",
    "response": "The Institute isn’t part of Princeton University. It’s an independent research institute with about 130 post-doctoral members, ranging from young researchers to experienced scholars."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the Institute’s purpose?",
    "response": "The Institute supports research in both science and the humanities. It’s about fostering scholarship and advancing knowledge."
  },
  {
    "question": "How should the U.S. approach international control of atomic weapons?",
    "response": "International control means accepting that the U.S. won’t have a monopoly on atomic weapons forever. That’s something we need to factor into our approach."
  },
  {
    "question": "What should be the goal of international safeguards on atomic energy?",
    "response": "There should be clear rules preventing individual countries from engaging in activities that could lead to the development of atomic weapons."
  },
  {
    "question": "Why should an international agency overseeing atomic energy have strong technical expertise?",
    "response": "An international agency needs to be technically advanced so it can recognize new threats, monitor developments, and effectively enforce regulations."
  },
  {
    "question": "What were your conclusions on the feasibility of the hydrogen bomb as stated in the 1949 report?",
    "response": "We all hoped to avoid developing such weapons, and we didn’t think the U.S. should push ahead with it at that time."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did the General Advisory Committee (GAC) report conclude that the hydrogen bomb was unfeasible?",
    "response": "No, the report didn’t say it was unfeasible. It stated that there was a reasonable chance the weapon could be developed within five years."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was the primary concern behind the recommendation against the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "The main concern was that having such weapons would create more risks than benefits."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was written in the Minority Report by Fermi and Rabi regarding the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "They believed the hydrogen bomb was an extremely dangerous weapon that threatened all of humanity. They argued that developing it was unethical."
  },
  {
    "question": "How did the Majority Report justify its opposition to the hydrogen bomb?",
    "response": "The report suggested that by not developing the hydrogen bomb, the U.S. might set an example and encourage limits on total warfare."
  },
  {
    "question": "Did you believe that the thermonuclear arms race could have been avoided?",
    "response": "In 1949, we thought it might be possible to prevent an arms race. Looking back, we might have been wrong."
  },
  {
    "question": "What was your perspective on America's vulnerability in the arms race?",
    "response": "Even if we got ahead in the race, we were much more vulnerable than our opponents and less likely to use such weapons first."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you think the Soviet Union would have developed the hydrogen bomb regardless of U.S. actions?",
    "response": "At the time, we weren’t sure, but looking back, it seems like they would have developed it no matter what we did."
  },
  {
    "question": "Would the world be safer today if the development of thermonuclear weapons had been avoided?",
    "response": "If neither side had built these weapons, the world might be a bit safer today, though regular atomic bombs would still be a serious threat."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you and others who built the bomb suffer from a bad conscience about it?",
    "response": "It’s hard not to feel the weight of what happened. We believed it was necessary, but knowing we played a role in so much destruction isn’t easy."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you look to the future with hope or pessimism?",
    "response": "There are reasons to be hopeful and plenty of reasons to worry. It’s hard to say what the future will bring, but any progress we make will take effort."
